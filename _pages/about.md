I am currently a PhD candidate from Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of British Columbia. My advisors are Prof. Karthik Pattabiraman and Prof. Matei Ripeanu. My research interests mainly focus on fault tolerance systems, GPUs and general HPC computing. I am also interested in various nascent domains such as qauntum computing.
