I received my PhD from Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of British Columbia. My advisors are Prof. Karthik Pattabiraman and Prof. Matei Ripeanu. My research interests mainly focus on fault tolerance systems, GPUs and HPC computing in general. I am also working on various nascent domains such as qauntum computing simulation and quantum machine learning. I joined Pacific Northwest National Laboratory as a research associate since April 2020. I received my B.Eng in Wuhan University, China.
