I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington. I received my Ph.D. in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of British Columbia. My advisors are Prof. Karthik Pattabiraman and Prof. Matei Ripeanu. My research interests mainly focus on fault-tolerant systems, GPUs and HPC computing in general. I am also working on quantum noise characterization and mitigation, quantum circuit simulation and quantum machine learning. I received my B.Eng in Wuhan University, China. 

Prior to UTA, I was a staff computer scientist in the HPC group at PNNL. 

I am the recipient of the William C. Carter PhD Dissertation Award in Dependability 2020, honourable mention of the 2020 SIGHPC Doctoral Dissertation Award, and the Exceptional Contribution Award of the HPC group at PNNL in 2022. I received the best paper award at IEEE Cluster 2022 and the best paper runner-up at ACM ICS 2025.
