I received my Ph.D. in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of British Columbia. My advisors are Prof. Karthik Pattabiraman and Prof. Matei Ripeanu. My research interests mainly focus on fault tolerance systems, GPUs and HPC computing in general. I am also working on various nascent domains such as quantum noise characterization and mitigation, quantum circuit simulation and quantum machine learning. I joined the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory as a research associate in April 2020. Currently, I am a staff computer scientist in the HPC group at PNNL. I received my B.Eng in Wuhan University, China. I am the recipient of The William C. Carter PhD Dissertation Award in Dependability 2020, honourable mention of the 2020 SIGHPC Doctoral Dissertation Award, and the Exceptional Contribution Award of the HPC group at PNNL in 2022.

I have served on the program committees of DSN2021/2022/2023/2025, HPDC2023, CCGRID2023, QCE2023, ICCAD2023, IPDPS2024, CCGRID2024 and ISSRE2024. I serve as the artifact evaluation co-chair of ISSRE 2023. I also organized the quantum-classical cooperative computing workshop (QCCC) in 2023 and 2024. I am co-chairing the FTXS24 and DSML24.
