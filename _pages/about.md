I received my PhD from Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of British Columbia. My advisors are Prof. Karthik Pattabiraman and Prof. Matei Ripeanu. My research interests mainly focus on fault tolerance systems, GPUs and HPC computing in general. I am also working on various nascent domains such as quantum noise characterization and mitigation, quantum circuit simulation and quantum machine learning. I joined Pacific Northwest National Laboratory as a research associate since April 2020. Currently I am a staff computer scientist in the HPC group at PNNL. I received my B.Eng in Wuhan University, China. 

My CV can be found <a href="https://flyree.github.io/files/bo_fang_cv_nov2022.pdf">here</a>

I have served on the program committees of DSN2021/2022/2023, HPDC2023, CCGRID2023, QCE2023, etc.. I am the artifact evaluation co-chairs of ISSRE 2023.
